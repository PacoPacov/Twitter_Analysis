Plan:
    Creating Label
        1) Afinn score
        2) MIT SO-CAL score
        3) Vader sentiment analysis - for social media text 
        4) Combine them and make a syntetic label, so that way we can try more ML algorithms
    After we have an label we can transform the data with:
        1) Bag Of Words
        2) TF-IDF
    Use the transformed data and the syntetic label in ML models to see how well they will predict the data.
